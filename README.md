# Hello World!

I'm **Meryl Perez**, a data sorceress, on a quest to turn every dataset into a compelling story.

# My Data Journey:

I took up electronics engineering for my bachelor’s degree. In my first job after graduation, I became a planning engineer. Instead of configuring devices and visiting cellsites, I am bound to my desk crunching numbers, and making sense out of data for strategic and competitive advantage. Here is where I met my long-time bestfriends, Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, Microsoft Access, and SQL. I also used to teach basic Python programming. I left the Philippines for an adventure to the land down under (Australia) where I pursued my master’s degree in business analytics. This education broaden my perspective in different industries.

### Moving to the US:
Finally closing my long distance relationship with my partner (now husband), I moved to the US. Recently, I earned my green card, securing a permanent place in the U.S. and opening doors to an exciting career here. I'm on the lookout for new opportunities to apply my data skills, make meaningful contributions, and help organizations harness the power of their information.

There’s more to me than data…

### From Dashboard to Board games

While I thrive on data, I'm not all algorithms and spreadsheets. I've got a side that adores logic puzzles and board games, which, incidentally, often involve a lot of strategizing and problem solving- a perfect match for my meticulous nature. When I'm not crunching numbers, you might find me in a fierce board game battle or solving sudokus.

### Musical Interludes and Literary Escapades:
In my spare time, I like to sing and play guitar, or listen to my favorite Kpop hits. If not, I immerse myself in the magical world of Harry Potter. Occasionally, I'll get lost in the pages of an intriguing book, exploring new adventures through the written word. Music, books, and data - they all have their unique way of telling stories, and I cherish each one.

If you're looking for someone to turn your data into a masterpiece or discuss the finer points of a complex board game, I'm your gal with a passion for precision. Let's make data sing and have some fun along the way!
